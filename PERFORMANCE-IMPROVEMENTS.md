## 🎯 Additional Recommendations (Optional)

While the website is now significantly faster, here are some additional optimizations you could consider in the future:

1. **Enable GZIP/Brotli Compression** on your server
   - Further reduce text file sizes (HTML, CSS, JS) by 60-80%
   
2. **Implement WebP Format** with fallbacks
   - Modern image format with even better compression (~30% smaller than JPEG)
   - Requires creating WebP versions of images + HTML updates
   
3. **Add a Content Delivery Network (CDN)**
   - Serve images from servers closer to your users
   - Reduces latency, especially for international visitors
   
4. **Minify CSS and JavaScript**
   - Remove unnecessary whitespace and comments
   - Can save additional 20-30% on text files
   
5. **Implement HTTP/2 or HTTP/3**
   - Faster protocol for serving multiple files
   - Check if your Netlify hosting supports it (likely already enabled)
